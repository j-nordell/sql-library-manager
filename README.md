# SQL Library Manager

Simple web app for managing the library database of books and authors. Does not account for the loan system.

To run the app you will need Node.js.

Navigate into the project directory. From the command line run:

```bash

npm install

```

Then run:

```

npm start

```

Check the terminal to see where the server is listening and navigate to that URL/port in your browser.

Note:  To prove the existence of 500 error handling, an additional route has been added to the project at `/books/error` where a 500 error is being intentionally created.
